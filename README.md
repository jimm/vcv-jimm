# Jimm's VCV plugins

## Arpeggiator

Based off the VCV sequencer, this module makes it easier to generate
specific notes and run them up, up/down, or randomly. Each row's notes can
be offset by an input voltage.

The pitch for each step is set by two knobs. The upper left knob sets the
semitone and the lower right sets the octave.

The voltage input at the left offsets the root pitch for each step.
